ReadME - Instructions to use tickiting system code
To run the code simpily open the Main.py file into visual studio code then press run at the top window, please do not change
any of the code 
 When you run the code in the terminal there will be text displayed
 that text will ask you what would you like to do, from there you have five options to pick from using the assigned letter
 if you do not pick any of those choices the code will loop with a warning letting you know that you will
 need to pick from one of the five options, First option you have C - Create new ticket, Second is D - Display a Ticket,
 Third is R - Respond to a Ticket, Fourth is A - Display all created and precreated tickets,
and last is E - To exit the code loop. These each should open into different menus where you will be able to
carry out the designated function.

C - Create a ticket 
      This function allows you to create a new ticket using the name of the ticket creator,
      staff ID, email address, and the description of the issue. These tickets will then be given a ticket number that will
      be assigned and can be viewed when using the (D)isplay function. upon creation these tickets will have no response,
      and will aslo have a open ticket status.

D - Display a ticket 
     This function will give you a question asking which tickey number you would like to view, when you put the Ticket
     number into the input and enter, the ticket that matches the ticket number you had entered will display on the screen
     There is also otherways of displaying all the tickets but that is using another function.

R - Respond to a ticket 
    This function allows you to repsond to a ticket with what ever text you enter, the tickets with the the job description
    as (password change) will have a automatic generated password allowing the response not to be needed when the job is
    password. You are able to change these response when ever you want.

A - Show All tickets 
    This function is similar to the display a ticket, but this will display every ticket made and every precreated ticket
    These will all be showed in a line showing a clear gap inbetween allowing for easy reading

E - Exit the Program, This command is very self obvious when you want to exit the loop (stop the code from looping in terminal)

From these commands you will be able to create, display, respond and, change tickets in a ticketing system.
